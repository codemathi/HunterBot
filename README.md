# Discord Chat Bot with Simple Machine Learning

This project is a Discord bot designed to learn from chat interactions and reply using a simple algorithm implemented with Python and SQLite. It's an exploration into building a basic machine learning model without relying on any specialized libraries.

## Features

- **Learning from Chat**: The bot observes chat interactions in Discord channels and learns from them over time.
- **Simple Algorithm**: Utilizes a straightforward algorithm to generate replies based on learned patterns.
- **SQLite Database**: Stores learned patterns and data for efficient retrieval and updating.
